Whether it was reducing Medicare fraud case preparation time from\n3 weeks to 2 days for the Tennessee Attorney General's Office, or developing\nglobal dashboards for HP, I focused on making data accessible and actionable.\nI also led the enterprise-wide migration from Domo to Power BI at Select\nWater, eliminating $1.2M in external consulting fees through internal resource\noptimization and technical leadership.\n\nI am eager to bring my entrepreneurial mindset and technical toolkit to help\ndrive insights and operational excellence.
