Site inventory data lived across **40+ Postgres tables**,\nand discrepancies between the database layer and the Dataverse reporting layer\nwere eroding trust in the numbers.\n\nThe specific challenges included:\n\n- **Misclassified site records** in Dataverse that didn't match the underlying\n  Postgres data, making asset visibility unreliable for field operations and\n  leadership reporting\n- **No standardized process** for identifying, diagnosing, or resolving\n  discrepancies — each analyst had their own ad-hoc approach\n- **Regional inconsistencies** in how data was entered, categorized, and\n  maintained, making cross-region comparison unreliable\n- **High-volume data** requiring queries that could handle complexity without\n  sacrificing accuracy — there was no room for \"close enough\"\n\n\n## The Approach {.project-section-heading}\n\nI designed a **systematic reconciliation framework** — not just a one-time\ncleanup, but a repeatable process the organization could use going forward.\n\n### Step 1 — Map the Data Landscape\n\nBefore writing a single query, I mapped the relationships between the 40+\nPostgres tables to understand how site inventory data flowed from source\nsystems into the reporting layer. This included:\n\n- Documenting table relationships, key fields, and join logic\n- Identifying which tables were authoritative for which data elements\n- Cataloging known data quality issues by region\n\n### Step 2 — Build Diagnostic Queries\n\nI developed a suite of SQL queries designed to surface discrepancies\nsystematically rather than chasing individual errors:\n\n```sql\n-- Example: Identify sites with mismatched status between\n-- Postgres source tables and Dataverse reporting layer\nSELECT\n    p.site_id,\n    p.site_name,\n    p.region,\n    p.operational_status  AS postgres_status,\n    d.operational_status  AS dataverse_status,\n    p.last_updated        AS source_updated,\n    d.last_modified       AS reporting_updated\nFROM site_inventory p\nINNER JOIN dataverse_sites d\n    ON p.site_id = d.site_id\nWHERE p.operational_status <> d.operational_status\nORDER BY p.region, p.site_name;\n```\n\nThese queries were designed to be **reusable** — parameterized by region,\ndate range, and data element so any analyst could run them going forward.\n\n### Step 3 — Document the Troubleshooting Framework\n\nFor each category of discrepancy, I documented:\n\n- **What it looks like** — the specific data pattern that indicates the issue\n- **Why it happens** — the root cause (data entry timing, system sync lag,\n  classification error, etc.)\n- **How to fix it** — the specific correction steps in Dataverse or the\n  source system\n- **How to prevent it** — process changes or validation rules to catch it\n  earlier\n\n### Step 4 — Correct and Validate\n\nWorking region by region, I applied corrections to misclassified site data\nin Dataverse, validating each change against the Postgres source of truth.\nEvery correction was logged for audit purposes.\n\n### Step 5 — Reporting Layer\n\nBuilt Power BI dashboards that surfaced reconciliation status by region,\ngiving leadership visibility into data quality metrics alongside operational\nKPIs — making data integrity a visible, measurable priority rather than a\nbackground assumption.\n\n\n## The Framework in Practice {.project-section-heading}\n\nThe troubleshooting framework I documented followed a decision-tree pattern:\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| fig-width: 8\nflowchart TD\n    A[Discrepancy Detected] --> B{Source data correct?}\n    B -->|Yes| C{Dataverse record exists?}\n    B -->|No| D[Trace to source system<br>& correct upstream]\n    C -->|Yes| E[Update Dataverse<br>classification]\n    C -->|No| F[Create Dataverse<br>record from source]\n    E -->

reconciliation from a **heroic individual effort** into a\n**repeatable team process**.\n\n\n## Visual Walkthrough {.project-section-heading}\n\n::: {.project-visuals}\n\n::: {.screenshot-grid}\n\n:::
