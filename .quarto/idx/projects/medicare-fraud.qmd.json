When I joined the team, the\nanalytical workflow had several critical bottlenecks:\n\n- **3-week turnaround** for dataset requests — analysts had to submit requests\n  through intermediaries to access TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program)\n  data, with no direct query capability\n- **Excel-based reporting** for attorney-facing deliverables, which limited\n  the depth of analysis and made it difficult to explore data interactively\n  during case preparation\n- **No standardized data organization** — each analyst structured their\n  outputs differently, creating inconsistencies across cases and making it\n  difficult for attorneys to compare analyses\n- **Time pressure** — fraud cases have legal deadlines, and a 3-week data\n  turnaround meant analysts were often working with stale information or\n  rushing to compensate for delays\n\n\n## The Approach {.project-section-heading}\n\nI tackled this from three angles simultaneously: **access**, **tooling**,\nand **process standardization**.\n\n### Securing Direct Database Access\n\nThe single highest-impact change was obtaining **direct access to the TennCare\ndatabase**. This required:\n\n- Building trust with the TennCare data team by demonstrating responsible\n  data handling practices and understanding of HIPAA compliance requirements\n- Documenting the specific query patterns the AG's office needed, showing\n  that direct access would reduce burden on the TennCare team (fewer ad-hoc\n  requests for them to fulfill)\n- Establishing protocols for secure data extraction and storage that met\n  both agencies' governance requirements\n\nThis alone collapsed the data turnaround from **3 weeks to 2–3 days** — the\ntime it takes to write, validate, and document a query rather than wait in\na request queue.\n\n### Modernizing the Reporting Stack\n\nI transitioned the team's attorney-facing deliverables from Excel to\n**Power BI**, which provided:\n\n- **Interactive exploration** — attorneys could filter by provider, date\n  range, procedure code, and billing pattern without requesting new reports\n- **Visual pattern detection** — fraud patterns that were invisible in\n  spreadsheet rows became obvious in visualizations (billing spikes,\n  geographic clustering, procedure code anomalies)\n- **Compliance-ready formatting** — standardized layouts that met\n  courtroom presentation requirements\n\n### Standardizing Data Organization\n\nI designed a consistent data organization framework for case analytics:\n\n- **Standard naming conventions** for datasets, queries, and deliverables\n- **Template structures** for common case types so new analyses started\n  from a proven foundation rather than a blank page\n- **Documentation requirements** for every dataset — source, extraction\n  date, query logic, and known limitations — so any analyst could pick up\n  where another left off\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| fig-width: 8\nflowchart LR\n    A[Case Assignment] --> B[Direct TennCare<br>Database Query]\n    B --> C[Data Extraction<br>& Validation]\n    C --> D[Standardized<br>Dataset Structure]\n    D --> E[Power BI<br>Analysis & Visuals]\n    E --> F[Attorney-Facing<br>Deliverable]\n    F --> G[Case Prosecution]\n\n    style B fill:#3B82F6,color:#fff\n    style E fill:#3B82F6,color:#fff\n```\n\n\n## Working with Sensitive Data {.project-section-heading}\n\nHealthcare fraud analytics involves **protected health information (PHI)**\nand legally sensitive case data. Every aspect of this project was designed\nwith compliance in mind:\n\n- All data access followed **HIPAA protocols** and agency security policies\n- Datasets were stored in secured, access-controlled environments\n- Power BI reports were designed for **internal use only** with appropriate\n  access restrictions\n- Query logic and analytical methods were documented for potential\n  **courtroom testimony** and cross-examination\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Recruiter Note\nDue to the sensitive nature of this work (active legal cases, protected\nhealth information), I cannot share specific datasets, dashboards, or case\ndetails.
