Monthly? Quarterly?\n- What data do you wish you had when making those decisions?\n- Where do you currently go to find answers, and what's frustrating\n  about that process?\n- What does \"good\" look like for each business unit?\n\nThis discovery shaped every subsequent design decision and ensured the\ndashboard solved real problems rather than displaying data for its own sake.\n\n### Phase 2 — Data Modeling\n\nBuilt a **star schema data model** that unified financial and operational\ndata into a single queryable structure:\n\n- Designed fact tables for financial transactions, operational volumes,\n  and capacity metrics\n- Created dimension tables for business units, facilities, time periods,\n  and asset categories\n- Developed DAX measures for calculated KPIs — margin percentages,\n  utilization rates, variance calculations, and period-over-period\n  comparisons\n\n### Phase 3 — Dashboard Development\n\nBuilt the dashboard in iterative cycles, validating each view with\nstakeholders before moving to the next:\n\n- **Executive Summary** — portfolio-level KPIs with traffic-light\n  status indicators\n- **Business Unit Views** — detailed performance by segment with\n  drill-through to facilities\n- **Operational Detail** — utilization, capacity, and throughput\n  metrics with trend context\n- **Variance & Forecasting** — actuals vs. forecast with automated\n  exception flagging\n\n### Phase 4 — Deployment & Adoption\n\n- Configured automated data refreshes to ensure the dashboard reflected\n  current operational reality\n- Trained executive users on navigation, drill-through, and filtering\n- Established a feedback loop for iterating on views based on how\n  leadership actually used the tool in practice\n\n\n## Visual Walkthrough {.project-section-heading}\n\n::: {.project-visuals}\n\n::: {.screenshot-grid}\n\n::: {.screenshot-item}\n::: {.screenshot-placeholder}\n[📊]{.placeholder-icon}\n[Executive Summary View]{.placeholder-title}\n[Portfolio KPIs — revenue, gross profit, margin, utilization]{.placeholder-text}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.screenshot-item}\n::: {.screenshot-placeholder}\n[🏢]{.placeholder-icon}\n[Business Unit Drill-Through]{.placeholder-title}\n[Segment performance with actuals vs. forecast]{.placeholder-text}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.screenshot-item}\n::: {.screenshot-placeholder}\n[⚙️]{.placeholder-icon}\n[Operational Metrics View]{.placeholder-title}\n[Utilization rates, capacity, throughput by facility]{.placeholder-text}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.screenshot-item}\n::: {.screenshot-placeholder}\n[📈]{.placeholder-icon}\n[Trend & Variance Analysis]{.placeholder-title}\n[Period-over-period trends with variance flagging]{.placeholder-text}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Screenshots Available\nAnonymized screenshots or a live walkthrough of the dashboard are available\nupon request during interviews.

Reporting asks: \"What happened?\" Decision support\nasks: \"What should we do about it?\"\n\nBy combining financial KPIs with operational drivers, the dashboard gives\nexecutives the full picture: not just that revenue is up or down, but what's\ndriving it — utilization, capacity, throughput, mix. That operational context\nis what turns a number on a screen into an actionable insight.\n\nThe design approach — starting with stakeholder decisions, not available\ndata — is something I bring to every project. The best dashboards aren't\nthe ones with the most data; they're the ones that answer the right questions.\n\n\n## Technical Stack {.project-section-heading}\n\n| Component | Technology | Purpose |\n|:----------|:-----------|:--------|\n| BI Platform | Power BI | Interactive dashboards, drill-through, scheduled refresh |\n| Data Sources | Postgres, Dataverse, Financial Systems | Operational, asset, and financial data |\n| Data Modeling | Star schema (DAX) | Unified fact/dimension model, calculated measures |\n| KPI Engine | DAX measures | Margin %, utilization rates, variance calculations |\n| Query Layer | SQL (Postgres) | Data extraction, validation, transformation |\n| Governance | Dataverse | Asset classification, data quality enforcement |\n| Refresh | Automated schedule | Near-real-time data currency |\n\n\n## Key Skills Demonstrated {.project-section-heading}\n\n::: {.skills-grid}\n\n::: {.skill-category}\n#### Dashboard Architecture\nEnd-to-end design from data model through interactive executive views with drill-through navigation\n:::\n\n::: {.skill-category}\n#### Stakeholder Discovery\nInterview-driven design that starts with decisions, not data — ensuring every view has a purpose\n:::\n\n::: {.skill-category}\n#### Data Modeling\nStar schema design unifying financial and operational data into a single queryable model\n:::\n\n::: {.skill-category}\n#### DAX & Calculated Measures\nComplex KPI calculations including margin percentages, utilization rates, and variance analysis\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.project-nav}\n[← Back to All Projects](../projects.qmd){.btn-secondary}\n[Next: Data Reconciliation →](data-reconciliation.qmd){.btn-primary}\n:::","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n::: {.project-hero}\n::: {.project-hero-content}\n\n# Executive Infrastructure Dashboard {.project-hero-title}\n\n**Role:** Lead Developer & Analyst\n· **Organization:** Select Water Services\n· **Status:** Production — Used by Executive Leadership\n\n::: {.project-hero-tags}\n`Power BI` `SQL` `Postgres` `Dataverse` `DAX` `Data Modeling` `KPI Design`\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Problem {.project-section-heading}\n\nSelect Water Services operates across multiple business units and facilities,\neach generating its own stream of financial and operational data.
