    "section": "The Approach",
    "text": "The Approach\nI designed a systematic reconciliation framework — not just a one-time cleanup, but a repeatable process the organization could use going forward.\n\nStep 1 — Map the Data Landscape\nBefore writing a single query, I mapped the relationships between the 40+ Postgres tables to understand how site inventory data flowed from source systems into the reporting layer. This included:\n\nDocumenting table relationships, key fields, and join logic\nIdentifying which tables were authoritative for which data elements\nCataloging known data quality issues by region\n\n\n\nStep 2 — Build Diagnostic Queries\nI developed a suite of SQL queries designed to surface discrepancies systematically rather than chasing individual errors:\n-- Example: Identify sites with mismatched status between\n-- Postgres source tables and Dataverse reporting layer\nSELECT\n    p.site_id,\n    p.site_name,\n    p.region,\n    p.operational_status  AS postgres_status,\n    d.operational_status  AS dataverse_status,\n    p.last_updated        AS source_updated,\n    d.last_modified       AS reporting_updated\nFROM site_inventory p\nINNER JOIN dataverse_sites d\n    ON p.site_id = d.site_id\nWHERE p.operational_status &lt;&gt; d.operational_status\nORDER BY p.region, p.site_name;\nThese queries were designed to be reusable — parameterized by region, date range, and data element so any analyst could run them going forward.\n\n\nStep 3 — Document the Troubleshooting Framework\nFor each category of discrepancy, I documented:\n\nWhat it looks like — the specific data pattern that indicates the issue\nWhy it happens — the root cause (data entry timing, system sync lag, classification error, etc.)\nHow to fix it — the specific correction steps in Dataverse or the source system\nHow to prevent it — process changes or validation rules to catch it earlier\n\n\n\nStep 4 — Correct and Validate\nWorking region by region, I applied corrections to misclassified site data in Dataverse, validating each change against the Postgres source of truth. Every correction was logged for audit purposes.\n\n\nStep 5 — Reporting Layer\nBuilt Power BI dashboards that surfaced reconciliation status by region, giving leadership visibility into data quality metrics alongside operational KPIs — making data integrity a visible, measurable priority rather than a background assumption."

    "text": "Dear Hiring Manager,\n\nI am writing to express my strong interest in joining your team. My professional background offers a unique intersection of hands-on operational management and advanced technical proficiency. Having progressed from managing front-line logistics divisions to leading enterprise-level data initiatives, I bring a rare perspective to the table: the ability to not only execute complex SQL and Power BI workflows but to ensure those technical solutions are grounded in real-world business logic and ROI. I specialize in bridging the gap between fragmented data and actionable strategy, ensuring that every insight drives departmental efficiency and bottom-line savings.\n\nFrom the Field to the Data Layer\nIn my current role as a Senior Data Analyst at Select Water Services, I specialize in transforming complex operational data into clarity. I recently reconciled site inventory data across four major regions — NE, Rockies, Permian, and MidCon — documenting troubleshooting frameworks to resolve discrepancies and ensure reporting accuracy. This experience in maintaining data integrity within Dataverse and Postgres environments directly aligns with any organization’s need for an analyst who understands data quality frameworks and governance.\n\n\nOperations Intuition Meets Technical Depth\nWhat sets me apart is my foundational experience in the logistics industry. During my tenure at Knight Transportation, I led a fleet of 60+ drivers and successfully reduced idle time from 55% to 20% while increasing gross revenue by 12%. I understand the “day in the life” of transportation processes, which allows me to evaluate systems and identify inefficiencies that a purely technical analyst might overlook.\n\n\nMaking Data Speak to Everyone\nI have a proven ability to translate complicated analytics for non-technical stakeholders. Whether it was reducing Medicare fraud case preparation time from 3 weeks to 2 days for the Tennessee Attorney General’s Office, or developing global dashboards for HP, I focused on making data accessible and actionable. I also led the enterprise-wide migration from Domo to Power BI at Select Water, eliminating $1.2M in external consulting fees through internal resource optimization and technical leadership.\nI am eager to bring my entrepreneurial mindset and technical toolkit to help drive insights and operational excellence. Thank you for your time and consideration.\nSincerely,\nEdward Shane Christian\n📧 schristian625@aol.com · 📱 615-852-0233 · 🔗 LinkedIn"

At Select Water, it means reconciling millions of records across regions so leadership can trust the numbers.\nI’m not a data analyst who learned operations — I’m an operations professional who mastered data. That distinction matters when the dashboard needs to reflect what’s actually happening on the ground."

    "text": "The Problem\nThe Tennessee Attorney General’s Office prosecutes Medicare fraud cases that involve large, complex healthcare datasets. When I joined the team, the analytical workflow had several critical bottlenecks:\n\n3-week turnaround for dataset requests — analysts had to submit requests through intermediaries to access TennCare (Tennessee’s Medicaid program) data, with no direct query capability\nExcel-based reporting for attorney-facing deliverables, which limited the depth of analysis and made it difficult to explore data interactively during case preparation\nNo standardized data organization — each analyst structured their outputs differently, creating inconsistencies across cases and making it difficult for attorneys to compare analyses\nTime pressure — fraud cases have legal deadlines, and a 3-week data turnaround meant analysts were often working with stale information or rushing to compensate for delays"

    "section": "The Approach",
    "text": "The Approach\nI tackled this from three angles simultaneously: access, tooling, and process standardization.\n\nSecuring Direct Database Access\nThe single highest-impact change was obtaining direct access to the TennCare database. This required:\n\nBuilding trust with the TennCare data team by demonstrating responsible data handling practices and understanding of HIPAA compliance requirements\nDocumenting the specific query patterns the AG’s office needed, showing that direct access would reduce burden on the TennCare team (fewer ad-hoc requests for them to fulfill)\nEstablishing protocols for secure data extraction and storage that met both agencies’ governance requirements\n\nThis alone collapsed the data turnaround from 3 weeks to 2–3 days — the time it takes to write, validate, and document a query rather than wait in a request queue.\n\n\nModernizing the Reporting Stack\nI transitioned the team’s attorney-facing deliverables from Excel to Power BI, which provided:\n\nInteractive exploration — attorneys could filter by provider, date range, procedure code, and billing pattern without requesting new reports\nVisual pattern detection — fraud patterns that were invisible in spreadsheet rows became obvious in visualizations (billing spikes, geographic clustering, procedure code anomalies)\nCompliance-ready formatting — standardized layouts that met courtroom presentation requirements\n\n\n\nStandardizing Data Organization\nI designed a consistent data organization framework for case analytics:\n\nStandard naming conventions for datasets, queries, and deliverables\nTemplate structures for common case types so new analyses started from a proven foundation rather than a blank page\nDocumentation requirements for every dataset — source, extraction date, query logic, and known limitations — so any analyst could pick up where another left off\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    A[Case Assignment] --&gt; B[Direct TennCare&lt;br&gt;Database Query]\n    B --&gt; C[Data Extraction&lt;br&gt;& Validation]\n    C --&gt; D[Standardized&lt;br&gt;Dataset Structure]\n    D --&gt; E[Power BI&lt;br&gt;Analysis & Visuals]\n    E --&gt; F[Attorney-Facing&lt;br&gt;Deliverable]\n    F --&gt; G[Case Prosecution]\n\n    style B fill:#3B82F6,color:#fff\n    style E fill:#3B82F6,color:#fff"

    "text": "Lessons Learned\n1. Access is the first bottleneck to solve. The most sophisticated analytical tools in the world don’t matter if you’re waiting 3 weeks for data. Securing direct database access was a relationship and trust-building exercise as much as a technical one — and it delivered the single largest time savings.\n2. Analysts aren’t the only users. Attorneys needed to interact with the data directly, not just receive static reports. Designing for their workflow (filtering by provider, exploring billing patterns, presenting in court) produced better outcomes than designing for analytical elegance.\n3. Standardization pays compound interest. The time invested in templates, naming conventions, and documentation standards felt slow at first, but it paid back exponentially as the team handled more cases in parallel with consistent quality."
