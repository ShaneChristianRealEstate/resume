# Hi, I'm **Shane Christian** {.hero-title}

### Senior Data Analyst · Operations-to-Analytics · SQL & Power BI Expert {.hero-subtitle}

I don't just query data — I understand the operations behind it. From managing
60+ drivers on the road to reconciling multi-region inventory across Postgres
and Dataverse, I bring a rare combination of frontline experience and advanced
technical skill.

<!-- ===== COVER LETTER ===== -->

## Dear Hiring Manager, {.section-heading}

::: {.letter-body}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the **Senior Data Analyst**
position. With a career that spans from managing driver divisions at Knight
Transportation to leading multi-system data reconciliation at Select Water
Services, I offer a rare combination of deep transportation domain knowledge
and advanced technical expertise in SQL and Power BI.

### From the Field to the Data Layer

In my current role as a Senior Data Analyst at Select Water Services, I
specialize in transforming complex operational data into clarity. I recently
reconciled site inventory data across four major regions — NE, Rockies,
Permian, and MidCon — documenting troubleshooting frameworks to resolve
discrepancies and ensure reporting accuracy. This experience in maintaining
data integrity within Dataverse and Postgres environments directly aligns with
any organization's need for an analyst who understands data quality frameworks
and governance.

### Operations Intuition Meets Technical Depth

What sets me apart is my foundational experience in the logistics industry.
During my tenure at Knight Transportation, I led a fleet of 60+ drivers and
successfully reduced idle time from 55% to 20% while increasing gross revenue
by 12%. I understand the "day in the life" of transportation processes, which
allows me to evaluate systems and identify inefficiencies that a purely
technical analyst might overlook.

### Making Data Speak to Everyone

I have a proven ability to translate complicated analytics for non-technical
stakeholders. Whether it was reducing Medicare fraud case preparation time from
3 weeks to 2 days for the Tennessee Attorney General's Office, or developing
global dashboards for HP, I focused on making data accessible and actionable.
I also led the enterprise-wide migration from Domo to Power BI at Select
Water, eliminating $1.2M in external consulting fees through internal resource
optimization and technical leadership.

I am eager to bring my entrepreneurial mindset and technical toolkit to help
drive insights and operational excellence. Thank you for your time and
consideration.

**Sincerely,**

**Edward Shane Christian**

<!-- ===== WHAT I DO ===== -->

## What I Bring to the Table {.section-heading}

::: {.value-grid}

::: {.value-card}
#### 🔍 Data Reconciliation & Governance
Multi-system data reconciliation across Postgres, Dataverse, and reporting
layers. I build troubleshooting frameworks that make data integrity repeatable,
not heroic.
:::

::: {.value-card}
#### 📊 Dashboard Design & BI Strategy
Power BI dashboards with drill-through capabilities — from global HP initiatives
to regional operational KPIs. I design for the decision-maker, not the data
model.
:::

::: {.value-card}
#### ⚡ Process Optimization
Operations background means I see inefficiencies others miss. I've turned 3-week
processes into 2-day turnarounds and identified $4K/month in unbilled revenue
hiding in plain sight.
:::

::: {.value-card}
#### 🤝 Stakeholder Translation
Attorneys, executives, nurses, drivers — I've built analytics for all of them.
I bridge the gap between technical complexity and business clarity.
