<!-- ===== CAREER NARRATIVE ===== -->
::: {.career-narrative-section}

## The Thread That Connects It All {.section-heading}

::: {.narrative-body}

Every role in my career shares a common thread: **finding what's broken
and making it work better.** At Knight Transportation, that meant cutting
idle time and boosting revenue. At the Attorney General's Office, it meant
turning a 3-week legal data process into a 2-day turnaround. At Select
Water, it means reconciling millions of records across regions so
leadership can trust the numbers.

I'm not a data analyst who learned operations — I'm an operations
professional who mastered data. That distinction matters when the
dashboard needs to reflect what's actually happening on the ground.
