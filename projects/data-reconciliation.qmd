## The Problem {.project-section-heading}

Select Water Services operates across four major regions — **Northeast,
Rockies, Permian, and MidCon** — each with its own operational cadence and
data entry patterns. Site inventory data lived across **40+ Postgres tables**,
and discrepancies between the database layer and the Dataverse reporting layer
were eroding trust in the numbers.

The specific challenges included:

- **Misclassified site records** in Dataverse that didn't match the underlying
  Postgres data, making asset visibility unreliable for field operations and
  leadership reporting
- **No standardized process** for identifying, diagnosing, or resolving
  discrepancies — each analyst had their own ad-hoc approach
- **Regional inconsistencies** in how data was entered, categorized, and
  maintained, making cross-region comparison unreliable
- **High-volume data** requiring queries that could handle complexity without
  sacrificing accuracy — there was no room for "close enough"


## The Approach {.project-section-heading}

I designed a **systematic reconciliation framework** — not just a one-time
cleanup, but a repeatable process the organization could use going forward.

### Step 1 — Map the Data Landscape

Before writing a single query, I mapped the relationships between the 40+
Postgres tables to understand how site inventory data flowed from source
systems into the reporting layer. This included:

- Documenting table relationships, key fields, and join logic
- Identifying which tables were authoritative for which data elements
- Cataloging known data quality issues by region

### Step 2 — Build Diagnostic Queries

I developed a suite of SQL queries designed to surface discrepancies
systematically rather than chasing individual errors:

```sql
-- Example: Identify sites with mismatched status between
-- Postgres source tables and Dataverse reporting layer
SELECT
    p.site_id,
    p.site_name,
    p.region,
    p.operational_status  AS postgres_status,
    d.operational_status  AS dataverse_status,
    p.last_updated        AS source_updated,
    d.last_modified       AS reporting_updated
FROM site_inventory p
INNER JOIN dataverse_sites d
    ON p.site_id = d.site_id
WHERE p.operational_status <> d.operational_status
ORDER BY p.region, p.site_name;
```

These queries were designed to be **reusable** — parameterized by region,
date range, and data element so any analyst could run them going forward.

### Step 3 — Document the Troubleshooting Framework

For each category of discrepancy, I documented:

- **What it looks like** — the specific data pattern that indicates the issue
- **Why it happens** — the root cause (data entry timing, system sync lag,
  classification error, etc.)
- **How to fix it** — the specific correction steps in Dataverse or the
  source system
- **How to prevent it** — process changes or validation rules to catch it
  earlier

### Step 4 — Correct and Validate

Working region by region, I applied corrections to misclassified site data
in Dataverse, validating each change against the Postgres source of truth.
Every correction was logged for audit purposes.

### Step 5 — Reporting Layer

Built Power BI dashboards that surfaced reconciliation status by region,
giving leadership visibility into data quality metrics alongside operational
KPIs — making data integrity a visible, measurable priority rather than a
background assumption.


## The Framework in Practice {.project-section-heading}

The troubleshooting framework I documented followed a decision-tree pattern:

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-width: 8
flowchart TD
    A[Discrepancy Detected] --> B{Source data correct?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Dataverse record exists?}
    B -->|No| D[Trace to source system<br>& correct upstream]
    C -->|Yes| E[Update Dataverse<br>classification]
    C -->|No| F[Create Dataverse<br>record from source]
    E --> G[Validate correction<br>against Postgres]
    F --> G
    D --> G
    G --> H[Log correction<br>for audit trail]
    H --> I[Confirm in Power BI<br>reporting layer]
```

This turned reconciliation from a **heroic individual effort** into a
**repeatable team process**.

### Additional Outcomes

- **Restored trust in reporting** — leadership could make operational
  decisions knowing the data reflected reality
- **Reduced future reconciliation time** — the documented framework and
  reusable queries meant subsequent reconciliation cycles were significantly
  faster
- **Improved data entry practices** — root cause documentation led to
  process changes that reduced new discrepancies at the source
- **Governance visibility** — Power BI dashboards made data quality a
  measurable KPI, not an invisible assumption


## Why This Project Matters {.project-section-heading}

Most organizations have data quality problems. What separates good analysts
from great ones is whether the fix is a one-time cleanup or a lasting
capability. This project delivered both — immediate corrections to restore
reporting accuracy, and a framework that ensures the organization can
maintain that accuracy going forward.

The key insight was treating data reconciliation as a **process design
problem**, not just a SQL problem. The queries were necessary but not
sufficient — the documentation, the decision trees, and the Power BI
visibility layer are what made it sustainable.
