## The Problem {.project-section-heading}

The Tennessee Attorney General's Office prosecutes Medicare fraud cases that
involve large, complex healthcare datasets. When I joined the team, the
analytical workflow had several critical bottlenecks:

- **3-week turnaround** for dataset requests — analysts had to submit requests
  through intermediaries to access TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program)
  data, with no direct query capability
- **Excel-based reporting** for attorney-facing deliverables, which limited
  the depth of analysis and made it difficult to explore data interactively
  during case preparation
- **No standardized data organization** — each analyst structured their
  outputs differently, creating inconsistencies across cases and making it
  difficult for attorneys to compare analyses
- **Time pressure** — fraud cases have legal deadlines, and a 3-week data
  turnaround meant analysts were often working with stale information or
  rushing to compensate for delays


## The Approach {.project-section-heading}

I tackled this from three angles simultaneously: **access**, **tooling**,
and **process standardization**.

### Securing Direct Database Access

The single highest-impact change was obtaining **direct access to the TennCare
database**. This required:

- Building trust with the TennCare data team by demonstrating responsible
  data handling practices and understanding of HIPAA compliance requirements
- Documenting the specific query patterns the AG's office needed, showing
  that direct access would reduce burden on the TennCare team (fewer ad-hoc
  requests for them to fulfill)
- Establishing protocols for secure data extraction and storage that met
  both agencies' governance requirements

This alone collapsed the data turnaround from **3 weeks to 2–3 days** — the
time it takes to write, validate, and document a query rather than wait in
a request queue.

### Modernizing the Reporting Stack

I transitioned the team's attorney-facing deliverables from Excel to
**Power BI**, which provided:

- **Interactive exploration** — attorneys could filter by provider, date
  range, procedure code, and billing pattern without requesting new reports
- **Visual pattern detection** — fraud patterns that were invisible in
  spreadsheet rows became obvious in visualizations (billing spikes,
  geographic clustering, procedure code anomalies)
- **Compliance-ready formatting** — standardized layouts that met
  courtroom presentation requirements

### Standardizing Data Organization

I designed a consistent data organization framework for case analytics:

- **Standard naming conventions** for datasets, queries, and deliverables
- **Template structures** for common case types so new analyses started
  from a proven foundation rather than a blank page
- **Documentation requirements** for every dataset — source, extraction
  date, query logic, and known limitations — so any analyst could pick up
  where another left off

## Working with Sensitive Data {.project-section-heading}

Healthcare fraud analytics involves **protected health information (PHI)**
and legally sensitive case data. Every aspect of this project was designed
with compliance in mind:

- All data access followed **HIPAA protocols** and agency security policies
- Datasets were stored in secured, access-controlled environments
- Power BI reports were designed for **internal use only** with appropriate
  access restrictions
- Query logic and analytical methods were documented for potential
  **courtroom testimony** and cross-examination

## Recruiter Note
Due to the sensitive nature of this work (active legal cases, protected
health information), I cannot share specific datasets, dashboards, or case
details. I'm happy to discuss the methodology, technical approach, and
analytical patterns in a conversation setting.

### Additional Outcomes

- **Stronger cases** — faster access to fresher data meant analyses were
  based on current information rather than snapshots that were weeks old
- **Attorney empowerment** — interactive Power BI reports let attorneys
  explore the data themselves during case preparation, reducing back-and-forth
  with the analytics team
- **Team scalability** — standardized processes and templates meant new
  analysts could become productive faster and produce consistent outputs
- **Cross-case pattern recognition** — standardized data structures made it
  easier to identify patterns that spanned multiple cases or providers


## Lessons Learned {.project-section-heading}

**1. Access is the first bottleneck to solve.**
The most sophisticated analytical tools in the world don't matter if you're
waiting 3 weeks for data. Securing direct database access was a relationship
and trust-building exercise as much as a technical one — and it delivered
the single largest time savings.

**2. Analysts aren't the only users.**
Attorneys needed to interact with the data directly, not just receive static
reports. Designing for their workflow (filtering by provider, exploring
billing patterns, presenting in court) produced better outcomes than
designing for analytical elegance.

**3. Standardization pays compound interest.**
The time invested in templates, naming conventions, and documentation
standards felt slow at first, but it paid back exponentially as the team
handled more cases in parallel with consistent quality.
