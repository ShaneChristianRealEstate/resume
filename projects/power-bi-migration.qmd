## The Problem {.project-section-heading}

Select Water Services operates across multiple business units and facilities,
each generating its own stream of financial and operational data. The executive
team needed a unified view to make informed, timely decisions — but what they
had was fragmented:

- **Scattered reporting** — financial performance, operational metrics, and
  capacity data lived in separate systems and separate reports, requiring
  manual consolidation to get a full picture
- **Lagging visibility** — by the time data was compiled and formatted for
  leadership, it was often days or weeks old, limiting its usefulness for
  real-time decision-making
- **No drill-through capability** — high-level summaries existed, but
  executives couldn't easily drill from a portfolio-level view down to
  individual business units or facilities without requesting ad-hoc reports
- **Disconnected financial and operational data** — revenue and margin
  figures were tracked separately from utilization rates, capacity, and
  throughput, making it difficult to see the operational drivers behind
  financial outcomes


## The Solution {.project-section-heading}

I designed and built a **comprehensive, real-time executive dashboard** in
Power BI that consolidated financial and operational performance into a
single, interactive platform.

### Design Philosophy

The guiding principle was: **every screen answers a decision.** Rather than
building a data dump with every available metric, I worked with executive
stakeholders to identify the specific decisions they make weekly and monthly,
then designed each dashboard view to directly support those decisions.

```

### What the Dashboard Delivers

**Financial Performance Layer:**

- **Revenue by business unit and facility** — with actuals vs. forecast
  comparison and variance highlighting so executives immediately see where
  results are tracking ahead or behind plan
- **Gross profit and margin percentages** — broken down by segment to
  assess the profitability mix across the portfolio and identify which
  units are driving margin expansion or compression
- **Period-over-period trending** — monthly and quarterly views that
  surface trajectory, not just snapshots, enabling executives to
  distinguish between one-time blips and emerging trends

**Operational Performance Layer:**

- **Utilization rates** — how effectively assets are being deployed across
  facilities, surfacing underutilized capacity that represents revenue
  opportunity or overutilized assets that signal risk
- **Capacity and throughput metrics** — real-time visibility into
  operational bottlenecks, enabling proactive resource allocation before
  constraints impact financial performance
- **Operational volume tracking** — activity-level metrics that provide
  context for the financial numbers, connecting revenue outcomes to the
  operational work that produces them

**Executive Decision Support:**

- **Drill-through from portfolio to facility** — executives start with
  a high-level view of all business units, then click through to
  individual facilities for granular detail without switching reports
- **Variance analysis** — automated flagging of actuals-to-forecast
  variances beyond threshold, so leadership focuses attention on the
  exceptions rather than reviewing every line item
- **Strategic alignment views** — progress tracking against strategic
  objectives, connecting daily operational metrics to quarterly and
  annual goals


## Implementation Approach {.project-section-heading}

### Phase 1 — Stakeholder Discovery

Before touching a data model, I spent time with the executive team to
understand their decision-making cadence:

- What decisions do you make weekly? Monthly? Quarterly?
- What data do you wish you had when making those decisions?
- Where do you currently go to find answers, and what's frustrating
  about that process?
- What does "good" look like for each business unit?

This discovery shaped every subsequent design decision and ensured the
dashboard solved real problems rather than displaying data for its own sake.

### Phase 2 — Data Modeling

Built a **star schema data model** that unified financial and operational
data into a single queryable structure:

- Designed fact tables for financial transactions, operational volumes,
  and capacity metrics
- Created dimension tables for business units, facilities, time periods,
  and asset categories
- Developed DAX measures for calculated KPIs — margin percentages,
  utilization rates, variance calculations, and period-over-period
  comparisons

### Phase 3 — Dashboard Development

Built the dashboard in iterative cycles, validating each view with
stakeholders before moving to the next:

- **Executive Summary** — portfolio-level KPIs with traffic-light
  status indicators
- **Business Unit Views** — detailed performance by segment with
  drill-through to facilities
- **Operational Detail** — utilization, capacity, and throughput
  metrics with trend context
- **Variance & Forecasting** — actuals vs. forecast with automated
  exception flagging

### Phase 4 — Deployment & Adoption

- Configured automated data refreshes to ensure the dashboard reflected
  current operational reality
- Trained executive users on navigation, drill-through, and filtering
- Established a feedback loop for iterating on views based on how
  leadership actually used the tool in practice

### What Changed for Leadership

- **Faster decisions** — executives no longer wait for compiled reports;
  they open the dashboard and have current data with drill-through
  capability at any time
- **Better decisions** — connecting financial outcomes to operational
  drivers in a single view means leadership sees *why* numbers are moving,
  not just *that* they're moving
- **Proactive management** — variance flagging and trend views surface
  problems early, enabling intervention before small issues compound
- **Aligned organization** — a shared dashboard creates a shared
  understanding of performance, reducing the "my spreadsheet says
  something different" problem in leadership meetings
- **Reduced ad-hoc burden** — the analytics team saw a significant
  reduction in one-off data requests because leadership could self-serve
  through drill-through navigation


## Why This Project Matters {.project-section-heading}

This wasn't a reporting project — it was a **decision-support platform**.
The difference matters. Reporting asks: "What happened?" Decision support
asks: "What should we do about it?"

By combining financial KPIs with operational drivers, the dashboard gives
executives the full picture: not just that revenue is up or down, but what's
driving it — utilization, capacity, throughput, mix. That operational context
is what turns a number on a screen into an actionable insight.

The design approach — starting with stakeholder decisions, not available
data — is something I bring to every project. The best dashboards aren't
the ones with the most data; they're the ones that answer the right questions.
